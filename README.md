This is my Coding Questionare for Coding Boot Camp.
I coded a Start button before you start the quiz as well as a next button once the user is done answering a question. Once finished the questionare will restart. 
There are easy questions right now because I'm still debugging and testing the functionality of the questionare. 
When you get an question right the screen should turn green ! 
When you get a question wrong the screen should turn red !
The hardest parts during this process was getting the timer to countdown as well as position it. 
Also having the timer equal to the total score of the questionare was difficult and confusing as its more a test of speed then it is an actual quiz. 
Lastly, the initals box in the end I still have to intergate.
Will continue to work on it.
